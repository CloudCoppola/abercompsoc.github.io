=====================

A jekell site cargo-culted from [daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo).

Developing
----------

If you're lucky enough to be running NixOS, run:

```bash
$ nix-shell . --run "jekyll s"
```

in this directory to generate and serve the site locally.

If you're on another platform, you'll need to install jekyll manually, then
run:

```bash
$ jekell s
```
    
See the [installation guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for more
details on manually installing.
