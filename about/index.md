AberCompSoc is the society for anyone and everyone interested in computer science, and all things related!

We put on fun events in Aber on a regular basis (including coding challenges, debates and presentations), as well as organising trips further afield (visits to Bletchley Park and FOSDEM are among the trips proposed for this year!). For those that like to get out, we also have a social every Friday night, which is a great place to meet and chat with like minded people.

Please sign up on the Student Union website (www.abersu.co.uk/societies/AberCompSoc/) and find us on facebook (www.facebook.com/groups/AberCompSoc/).
